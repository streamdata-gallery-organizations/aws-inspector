  quickly, Amazon Inspector includes a knowledge base of hundreds of rules mapped
  to common security best practices and vulnerability definitions. Examples of built-in
  rules include checking for remote root login being enabled, or vulnerable software
  versions installed. These rules are regularly updated by AWS security researchers.
